 * Detects if the app is running inside the Android native WebView (top-level frame).
 *
 * Two conditions must both be true:
 * 1. AndroidNative.isNativeApp() returns true (JS Bridge injected by native app)
 * 2. window === window.top (we are in the top-level frame, not an iframe)
 *
 * Condition 2 is critical: Android's addJavascriptInterface injects the bridge
 * into ALL frames including child iframes. When PortForwardBrowser opens a
 * ClawBench dev page in an iframe, it inherits the bridge but should run in
 * web mode (no port forward button, no native auto-login, etc.).
 * User-Agent is intentionally NOT checked — it's inherited by iframes and
 * causes false positives in port-forwarded pages.
